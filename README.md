# Python Analysis

In Python, I utilized libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib for data visualization.

I used Python to answer the following questions:

Total transactions by month

Total transactions by day

Total transactions by hour

Total transactions by store

Total revenue by month

Total transactions by product category

The best-selling product


# MySql
For this project I used star schema data modeling technique and classified dataset into dimensions tables and fact table.
# Tableau analysis 
In Tableau I used charts, tables and KPIs that provide quick insights into the data set. 
The following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are provided in dashboards:
1.	Total Sales 

  	Percentage difference in sales vs previous month

  	Min and max values 
3.	Total  Orders 

    Percentage difference in orders vs previous month
  	
    Min and max values 
5.	Total Quantity
   
    Percentage difference in quantity vs previous month
  	
    Min and max values 

Sales analysis
1.	Analyze the number of items sold and revenue generated
2.	Follow sales trend over the period
3.	Monitor the best-selling products.
4.	Monitor the peak hour and days when occurs the most of transactions

Insights:

June saw the highest number of orders, generating $166k, with an average sales of $5.5k across all stores. 
In contrast, February had the lowest number of orders and revenue, totaling $76k, with an average sales of $2.7k across all stores reflecting a 6.77% decrease compared to the previous month.
Revenue across the stores is relatively consistent, with Hell's Kitchen generating $236,511, Astoria generating $232,243, and Lower Manhattan generating $230,057.
